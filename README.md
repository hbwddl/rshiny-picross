# Picross in RShiny

This is the code for my [picross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram) game, created using RShiny and [hosted on shinyapps.io](https://hbwaddel.shinyapps.io/Picross/). Picross is my favorite puzzle game, and I wanted to challenge myself while I learned RShiny.

I am proud of the fact that this app runs from one .R file using only ~239 lines of code!
